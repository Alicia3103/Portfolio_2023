This is my first Portfolio.

Need to code a quick Portfolio to increase my visibility and try to find my first job as Junior developper.
Inspired by some online Tutorials and wanted to personnalize them after.

No complicated things to start this projet it's just HTML, SASS and a little bit of Grid. Feel free to use this code for your portfolio (and personnalize it).
